            Food wastage is a pressing global issue that affects both developed and developing nations. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), around 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted annually, which represents nearly one-third of the food produced for human consumption. This wastage happens at different stages of the food supply chain, from production and transportation to retail, consumption, and disposal. Reducing food wastage is critical not only for economic reasons but also for environmental sustainability, resource conservation, and alleviating global hunger.
        </p>
        <p>
            A significant portion of food wastage occurs at the production level, especially in developing countries. Poor harvesting techniques, lack of proper storage facilities, and inadequate infrastructure lead to significant losses. For instance, grains, fruits, and vegetables may rot in the field due to inefficient harvesting practices, while poor weather conditions can also result in significant spoilage. After production, food needs to be transported to markets, which can cause wastage due to delays, improper packaging, and poor handling.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the retail level, large amounts of food are discarded due to cosmetic imperfections or because they are close to their expiration dates. Supermarkets often reject produce that doesnâ€™t meet aesthetic standards, leading to unnecessary waste. In households, over-purchasing, improper meal planning, and misunderstanding food expiration labels cause a large amount of food to be thrown away. Restaurants also discard uneaten food due to large portion sizes.
