        <p>Better Meal Planning : Encourage people to plan meals ahead of time, make shopping lists, and buy only what they need. This prevents over-purchasing and reduces food waste at the household level.</p>
        <p>Understand Food Labels : Educate consumers on the difference between "use by," "sell by," and "best before" dates to avoid discarding food that is still safe to consume.</p>
        <p>Food Donation Programs : Establish and promote food recovery networks where surplus food from supermarkets, restaurants, and homes can be donated to food banks or shelters.</p>
        <p>Smaller Portion Sizes : Restaurants and households can serve smaller portions to minimize leftover food. Restaurants could also offer multiple portion sizes on their menus.</p>
        <p>Composting Organic Waste : Encourage individuals, schools, and businesses to compost organic food waste. Composting turns food scraps into valuable soil instead of letting them decompose in landfills.</p>
        <p>Improved Storage Techniques : Teach consumers and farmers better ways to store food to prolong freshness, such as using proper packaging, refrigeration, and airtight containers.</p>
        <p>Technology in Supply Chain Management : Use artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics to optimize food production and distribution. These technologies can predict demand more accurately, reducing overproduction and waste.</p>
